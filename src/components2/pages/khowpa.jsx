        <p>
          Khwopa Engineering College (KhEC), an undertaking of Bhaktapur
          Municipality, is Nepal's first community-based engineering college.
          KhEC was established in 2001 A.D. (2058 B.S.) in affiliation with the
          highly esteemed Purbanchal University, Nepal.
          <br />
          KhEC was initiated with the vision of establishing Bhaktapur as the
          center of excellence, thereby intellectualizing the entire society
          through engineering knowledge.
          <br />
          KhEC aims to provide the nation engineers and architects, dedicated to
          the country and people, with sound theoretical and practical
          knowledge, competence, and skill. KhEC is dedicated to providing
          quality education with an affordable fee accessible to people from
          economically common strata of society.
          <br />
          KhEC conducted Bachelor in Civil Engineering (4 Years) and
          Architecture (5 Years) from 2001, BE in Computer Engineering from
          2002, and BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering from 2003.
          Accordingly, KhEC conducted ME in Earthquake Engineering from 2005 and
          MSc in Urban Design and Conservation from 2006.
          <br />
          KhEC is well driven ahead by wise management, competent and
          enthusiastic academic faculty, and sound physical and academic
          infrastructure, being strongly backed by the people of Bhaktapur. The
          goals are being well materialized through regular classes, in-depth
          practical assignments, field studies, excursions, and report writing
          and internal examinations which are recipes for the success of every
          student, are carefully managed.
          <br />
          Within a short span of establishment, KhEC has been an attractive
          destination for students from all over the Nation who aspire to become
          competent engineers and architects.
          <br />

        <p>
          Founded in 2011, The British College offers world-class education for
          aspiring students in Nepal to gain internationally-recognised
          qualifications from their two partner British Universities: the
          University of the West of England (UWE) and Leeds Beckett University
          (LBU). We have successfully established a distinctive identity as the
          pioneering global college in Nepal and offer reputed UK degrees and
          courses that are relevant to the current job market, and enhance the
          employability of each and every student. Our aim is to provide
          students with a global learning experience and worldwide
          opportunities. We are further defined by our local-to-global approach
          in the provision of our degrees and courses which are staffed by
          tutors and administrative personnel from the UK and Nepal. In this
          way, the College provides premium education that compels students and
          staff to be globally-minded - a notion which is further encouraged by
          the multinational companies involved in our student exchange
          programmes and internships. We also believe that supporting and
          interacting with the local community is an integral part of student
          life, and we are committed to achieving excellence in our research and
          upholding the highest standards of integrity.
